You have two sources of slug updates:
    Auto-generation from Title
        -Done via watch("title") (useEffect hook)
    Manual user edits
        -Done via this onInput (whenever there is some change update slug on realtime)
    e.currentTarget.value = event.currentTarget i.e current input field ki value.
                
Yes, the code WILL still work without "onInput".
But it will behave differently. The difference is intentional.

What happens if you REMOVE onInput
You already have this:

        watch((value, { name }) => {
        if (name === "title") {
            setValue("slug", slugTransform(value.title), { shouldValidate: true });
        }
        });

Behavior then : 
    -User types in Title
    -Slug is auto-generated from Title
    -Slug field updates correctly
    -Validation runs
    -✅ Works

'If the user never touches the Slug field, you’re done.'
    ###  BUT:
What breaks WITHOUT "onInput"

The moment the user manually edits the Slug field:

        (User can type:

        Hello World !!! @@@)

React Hook Form accepts it as-is

watch does NOT run, because:

    name === "slug"  // ignored


Invalid slug enters form state

Validation might catch it, but format is not enforced

So:
Auto-generation works
Manual correction is not normalized

Why useEffect + watch() is NOT enough

    Because it listens only to:
        if (name === "title")


That logic:

Responds to Title changes only

Completely ignores Slug changes

This is by design to avoid loops.

If you try to also listen to "slug" there:

You’ll create infinite update cycles

Slug change → setValue → slug change → setValue → …

Role separation (this is the key insight)
Mechanism	            Responsibility
watch + useEffect	    Auto-generate slug from title
onInput	Enforce slug format when user edits slug

They solve two different problems.

Why not rely only on validation?

Because:

Validation tells you something is wrong

onInput prevents wrong data from entering at all

Prevention > correction.

This is not redundancy. It is deliberate separation of concerns.
